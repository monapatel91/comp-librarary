# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support every version post `1.0.0` as anything prior to that was a `prerelease` marked as `alpha`

| Version       | Supported          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x         | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.0.0.alpha.x | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use GitHub & NPM's security advisory process for reporting vulnerabilities.

You can submit a vulnerability through the [@digital-ai/dot-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digital-ai/dot-components) package on NPM.

## Vulnerability Resolution

We will review and address accordingly, keeping you up-to-date via your original GitHub issue.
We will review and address all security vulnerabilities accordingly within 30 days.
Our goal is to release every two weeks unless there is a need for doing so earlier.

When we fix a security issue, we will post a security advisory on Github/NPM,
describe the change in the [release notes](https://github.com/digital-ai/dot-components/releases).
