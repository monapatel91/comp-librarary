The `[COMPONENT]` component is an existing component that needs to be converted to be a styled component, its API needs to be updated to be consistent with other components in the library, and it needs to go through a UX review to make sure that it matches up with design specifications.

- [ ] Convert to styled components
- [ ] Review API and make sure that it is consistent with other components and ensure it is documented accurately
- [ ] UX review based on [mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/Ol8PQ9xs58n7I5uWJr9xNa/dot-components-library)
- [ ] Add commonProps for each component
- [ ] Update change log with updates made
- [ ] Move the component into the Component section in Storybook
- [ ] Remove the experimental comment above the component implementation

### UX Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Need @BojanKocijan's review
