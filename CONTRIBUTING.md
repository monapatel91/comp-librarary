# Getting Started

## Run demo application

To run the demo application run `yarn start`. You can then see the running application at <http://localhost:4200/>.

## Run Storybook

When creating new components it's easiest to use Storybook as your reference point. You should make sure that all `props` are setup as `actions` on Storybook so that users can experiment with the various options. Please also make sure to document each `prop` accordingly.

To run Storybook locally run `yarn storybook`. You can then see Storybook running at <http://localhost:4400/>.

## Code Styleguide

This is a work in progress...

- Order all props alphabetically, this allows for easier maintenance of larger components.

## Commit Messages

When working on something that is part of a GitHub issue we request that you use the following format with your commit messages. Doing so will allow your commit message to properly link to the related issue.

```sh
'Issue #1: some message here'
```

When working on something that is part of a Digital.ai Agility issue we request that you use the following format with your commit messages. Doing so will allow your commit message to properly link to the story in Agility if the GitHub integration is setup properly.

```sh
'S-12345: some message here'
```

## Running Tests and Formatters

### Running unit tests

Unit tests are run via [Jest](https://jestjs.io). The following commands can be used to run unit tests for the component library:

```sh
# execute all unit tests
yarn test

# execute unit tests in watch mode
yarn test --watch
```

### Running end-to-end tests

e2e tests are run via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The following commands can be used to run e2e tests for the component library:

```sh
# execute all e2e tests
yarn e2e

# execute e2e tests in watch mode
yarn e2e --watch
```

**_Note:_** When running e2e tests in watch mode Storybook is also running and available.

### Running linter

We use eslint for linting our source code. You can check the component library for lint issues by running `yarn lint` locally.

### Checking code style

For code formatting we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Any overrides that we have configured to the default Prettier rules is defined in the `.prettierrc` file.

You can use the following scripts to help you check for and fix any code format issues that you have:

```sh
# check for format issues
yarn format:check

# to fix any format issues
yarn format
```

## Generate a component

To generate a component execute use following commands:

```sh
# dry run to see what files will be generated
yarn generate:comp:dry --name=[name of component] --export --pascalCaseFiles

# the real thing
yarn generate:comp --name=[name of component] --export --pascalCaseFiles
```

## Updating font icon

For details go to [.dot design system](https://zeroheight.com/4a9ac476a/p/13a447-icons/t/36e685)

You can import `dot-components/src/lib/fonts/font-icon/selection.json` back to the IcoMoon app using the _Import Icons_ button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.

After downloading generated files from icomoon only the following files should be copied over and a pull request submitted.

```sh
- dot-components/src/lib/fonts/font-icon/fonts/*
- dot-components/src/lib/fonts/font-icon/selection.json
- dot-components/src/lib/fonts/font-icon/style.css
- dot-components/src/lib/fonts/font-icon/style.scss
- dot-components/src/lib/fonts/font-icon/variables.scss
```

You won't need any of the files located under the `demo-files/` directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

When you're done be sure to update [the package number](#set-the-package-version-number)

# Definition of Done

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

# Publishing

## Publishing as NPM package to GitHub Packages

In order to publish you will need to have authenticated to GitHub Packages. If you haven't done so already [Authenticating](/README.md) for instructions.

### Set the package version number

<!-- TODO: come up with a better and more consistent way of setting the version number -->

Set the new version number for the package in the `/libs/dot-components/package.json` file. Create a commit with the new version number.

- adding a new component should be an increase of `0.0.1`
- adding a new font icon should be an increase of `0.0.1`
- once a new set of components are added an increase of `0.1.0`
- breaking changes will be an increase of `1.0.0`

### Build and publish

To build and publish the library run the following commands:

```sh
# just build
yarn build

# build and publish
yarn build:publish
```
